1.	Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
The Sparkify company needs to study their data that they have about songs and how customers are behaving in their app. Their analytics team wants to know which songs the customers are listening to. Since the data is currently in JSON logs directory, they need to find a easier way to access it to analyse it.
A data engineer now has to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. The goal is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. We also test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare results with their expected results.

2.	How to run the Python scripts:
The python scripts are run using the terminal and the commands:
Python create_tables.py
Python etl.py


3.	An explanation of the files in the repository
Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulatorbased on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations. The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month.
We also have: 
•	test.ipynb displays the first few rows of each table to check the database.
•	create_tables.py drops and creates tables. Run this file to reset tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
•	etl.ipynb reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
•	etl.py reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables.
•	sql_queries.py contains all sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
•	README.md gives all information about the project

4.	State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.
 
Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.
Fact table:
•	songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong. songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
Dimension table:
•	users - users in the app
•	songs - songs in music database
•	artists - artists in music database
•	time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
